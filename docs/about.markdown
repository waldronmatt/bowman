# About

## Introduction

Bowman is a simple static site generator powered by Node.js, Webpack, and Browsersync. Bowman comes with pre-configured scripts to bundle assets, generate markup, and hot-reload pages. Pages are generated using the J.E.N. technology core (JSON - data, EJS - templating, Node.js - markup generation).

## Why use Bowman?

Why use Bowman when there are a lot of other options to choose from?

With Bowman, you can focus on creating your website without worrying about your build process. Bowman handles all the work to recursively find, build, and hot reload page/asset changes.

In contrast with other larger static site generators, Bowman makes a lot of decisions on your behalf to make things easy, but don't worry! You can easily customize and integrate your own build and server configurations using Webpack and Browserysnc.
